# Drag and Drop UI in React.js

This project is a React.js application that provides a drag-and-drop interface on a canvas where users can:
- Add cards with dummy text (showing only half the text initially with a "Show More" button).
- Connect cards using arrows.
- Resize cards as needed.
- Scroll the canvas.
- Drag and drop cards anywhere on the canvas.
- Open a detailed text of the card in a popup by clicking "Show More".

## Features
1. **Resizable Cards**: Each card on the canvas can be resized as per the user's preference.
2. **Connect Cards**: Users can connect cards using arrows to establish relationships between them.
3. **Drag-and-Drop**: Cards can be moved around the canvas using drag-and-drop functionality.
4. **Scrollable Canvas**: The canvas is scrollable to accommodate many cards and connections.
5. **Detailed View in Modal**: Clicking "Show More" on a card opens a modal with detailed text.
